#### Build project and lint it
```sh
npm install
npm run lint
```

#### Run it

```sh
npm run dev
```

#### Releasing
Releases are meant to be triggered by Travis, but not implemented yet. Tentative thoughts about how
it should work:

1. Update `package.json` with a new version
1. Run `npm install` so that `package-lock.json` is also up-to-date
1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with relevant changes, in sections **New features**, **Fixes**
1. Commit those changes, push a PR and land it
1. Create a [new release](https://github.com/schibsted/account-sdk-browser/releases/new) and name it
   according to the version number you just placed in `package.json`
1. Public Travis should be triggered
1. **WISHY-WASHY stuff here**: When public Travis succeeds, it should do a curl-POST to internal
   Travis to trigger a build in a "fake repo" that just pulls from the public repo, builds docker
   image and pushes to internal docker registry
1. Internal spinnaker should be triggered
